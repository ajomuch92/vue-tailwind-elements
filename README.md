1. Set up the Tailwind configuration files. Follow this [link](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) to do it.

2. Install from NPM (both libraries):  
```bash
npm install tw-elements vue-tailwind-elements
```
Import in your main.js (or index.js) file and install it:

```javascript
...
import 'tw-elements';
import VueTailwindElements from 'vue-tailwind-elements';

Vue.use(VueTailwindElements);
...
```

## Nuxt:
Put the last configuration into a plugin file and the use it into the nuxt.config.js file like this:

```javascript
...
  plugins: [
    { src: '~/plugins/vue-tailwind-elements.js', mode: 'client' }
  ],
...

```

And add this line to your tailwind.config.js file::

```javascript
...
  module.exports = {
    content: [
      './node_modules/vue-tailwind-elements/**/*.{js,ts,vue}'
    ],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [
      require('tw-elements/dist/plugin')
    ],
  }
...

```
